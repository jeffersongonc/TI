Everything functions perfectly - camera, battery life, speakers, face recognition, etc., and it looks brand new. I read several reviews that mentioned that you can‚Äôt turn the camera click off - no problem here. And there was no issue getting it set up with our service provider (Sprint). When considering buying this phone based on reviews, consider a few things: this is hundreds of dollars cheaper than buying one new, Amazon‚Äôs return service is impeccable so if worst comes to worst, just return it and get another one, and also consider the fact that on average only roughly 10% of people even bother writing Amazon reviews and that a majority of the people leaving 1 star reviews probably wouldn‚Äôt have written a review at all if everything checked out like this phone did (I almost forgot to write a review myself). Then consider the fact that a majority of reviewers gave the phone 5 stars and you begin to see how if you‚Äôre interested in saving money this is an excellent route as you‚Äôre not likely going to do much better than this for the money.",6.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone X, 256GB, Silver - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Fully-Unlocked-256GB/dp/B0775451TT,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81yZOQEC+NL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0775451TT,436,479.0,749.99
41706,B0775451TT,Amazon Customer,3,"July 25, 2019",True,"Camera shutter sound won't turn off, even when the phone is muted and all sound settings are off","The phone arrived right on time and in great condition. The charger that was included worked great. However, I think this phone must be from Korea or Japan, where it's apparently illegal to take digital photos without an audible shutter click. There is absolutely no way to turn off the sound, even when the phone is muted and the volume is turned all the way down. It happens in every major application that uses the camera. As an art student, I take TONS of pictures, and the camera is the primary reason why I got the iPhone X. I took it to multiple IT stores where they told me to either return the phone or to jailbreak it to rewrite the lines of code that affect the feature (and jailbreaking voids any warranty or service that Apple offers). I'm returning it because it's too big of a hiccup to work around (can't take pictures in a wedding/library/quiet setting at all...!). Ideally, they should make sure that the country of origin is taken into consideration before selling someone a product if it's going to be such a major feature difference.

41711,B0775451TT,Chad Bambrick,1,"September 19, 2019",True,Not as they claim,"This item is claimed to be a ""functioning like new"" device, but this is NOT TRUE AT ALL. Let me walk through this dramatic tragedy in detail. I had been monitoring the package from the moment after purchase, so it wasn't an accident that on that bright, sunny day I was waiting by the mailbox as the delivery truck cruised in. Grabbing my package, I ran inside, ecstatic at the prospect of my newest gadget. Gazing at that chrome-plated beauty, I knew love at first sight was true. As I set up this electronic treasure, I tap into ""settings"" to feast my eyes on the sight you rarely see in an iPhone... the battery at full capacity reader proudly gleaming a 100% like-new condition. But no, what sight met my eyes gave me a horror as you would not believe. Eighty....... Three...... Percent...... Now my mind was racing. I had already vowed til death do us part, but now looking at my bride's screen I realized what I had to do. I needed a second doctors opinion. I scheduled an appointment as soon as we returned from the honeymoon with Apple Memorial Hospital, and settled in to an uneasy vacation with my new love.... it was then that tragedy struck. As I started editing a slow motion video of a man breaking an egg on his forehead, the screen flickered and died. I gently tried to shake her awake, hitting the power and volume button up and down (Mainly down. A volume button being obviously a huge plus on a wife) As I rushed her to the ER at the nearest Apple Memorial Hospital I feared the worst. And the worst is what I got. Her heart, (known as a smart board) had failed. She would never speak to me again. I never saw her eyes open since that day, and I'll never forget the last image I saw of her, as the egg was making it's final impact on that man's head. I don't tell this story for self pity. I realize that this may be emotional for many of you to recall similar moments in your life's past. Perhaps even recent past. I share this only from a place of love and concern for other members of this community in the Amazon, that you don't make the same mistakes as I did. I will add one last word and say I have found support groups especially helpful during this emotional time. Thank you all for your time, and I hope you never buy.. *ahem, marry* a bride from this father-in-law.

I have held off on writing a review in hopes that this phone would improve but it continues to be crap. My first issue with this phone is it's lack of a headphone jack. Now when I purchased this phone I knew I would have to carry around an adapter and I was willing to accept that; however, I was not prepared for my phone to not play music or connect even when I had said adapter. Furthermore, it used to not continuously charge meaning I would constantly have to re-plug it in and now it refuses to charge all together. Also, it will stop playing songs or Siri will turn on (even after I disabled her) for no reason. In addition, the camera will constantly freeze when I try to zoom in which has often stopped me from taking amazing photos. All in all this phone is glitchy, not worth the money, ugly (I mean did they really think making the top dip down was a good idea?), and will ultimately annoy you to the point where you have to write a rant online and not even on the official website because apple doesn't want to hear people's opinions.",28.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone X, 256GB, Silver - For AT&T / T-Mobile (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Fully-Unlocked-256GB/dp/B0775451TT,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81yZOQEC+NL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0775451TT,436,479.0,749.99
42045,B0775451TT,Christopher Galgon,4,"September 1, 2018",False,"The Cell Phone Equivalent of a Concept Car, for Better and Worse.","The iPhone X is the most exciting phone I've owned since the iPhone 3GS so many years ago. I only recently had an opportunity to get one and it looks amazing, its cameras are spectacular and its quickness can be felt everywhere. Apple knew their design would be exciting, so they skipped over number 9 and made it the ""10,"" as if to say they're showing you a window to the future, just like a concept car. But as we all know, concept cars rarely end up on the assembly line without a few changes, and with good reason. Here's why the iPhone X, for all its power and beauty, really just deserves a ""B"" for its design: 1) The phone's signature looks turn anonymous inside a case. 2) The phone's surfaces all scratch easily. 3) It is the most slippery phone I've ever encountered. Add these things together, and you have a beautiful phone that MUST be put in an obscuring case, which makes its beauty kind of pointless. Inside a case and switched off, it doesn't even have Apple's signature circular button to identify itself. As of right now, I only have glass protectors on the front and back, but I know what will happen if I keep it like this long-term. The other new feature on the iPhone X is Face ID, or ""expensive way to avoid having a button on the front of the phone."" It works fine, but requires mild adjustments in how you use your phone and is definitely no better than Touch ID. I turned off the ""attention detection,"" meaning I don't have to be looking directly at the phone to unlock it, and now it is quick and unobtrusive. Finally, there's the ""notch."" This is a non-issue. I don't know what the fuss is about unless you're a software designer. Moving on. All in all, I've had my iPhone X for a couple months and couldn't be happier. It is not perfect, and I'll bet it'll be completely replaced by Fall 2019 (now that designer Jonny Ive is back in charge), but I'm loving everything about it.

I was unimpressed with any enhanced features, and namely the new face recognition to unlock the device. After the first two days of owning the new iPhone, I was over it. Gone was the ease of simply using a finger print to unlock the phone. This became annoying since I have to have a passcode on the phone and many apps I use day to day require either a pin or passcode which would generally use the finger id. Yes, the face recognition would unlock the device, but I had to literally pickup the phone every time I wanted to access email, text messages, or review information in an app. Previously, my phone could rest on my desk, I simply use my finger id to unlock and easily access whatever. Now, I have to pick up the phone or make it obvious I am accessing something on my phone. Aside from the new facial recognition, there is nothing really feature enhanced from the iPhone 7. Sure, you can argue, better camera etc, but that is minimal and not worth the money or upgrade with something already awesome.

42555,B077578W38,Jennah,4,"April 11, 2019",True,Good phone. Good price. üòä,"So far the phone has been great. It came with a small but noticeable scratch on the back glass, which was expected. I was very disappointed with how it was packaged and protected in the packaging. I‚Äôve bought screen protectors that have come in a more secure package. It came in a box inside a padded envelope. When I opened the envelope my box was destroyed (which I do know isn‚Äôt the fault of the seller but of bad shipping and handeling. My point is that it should‚Äôve been protected in the event that the shipping wasn‚Äôt careful). It was pure luck that the phone itself wasn‚Äôt broken. It just didn‚Äôt give me the best feeling. I was disappointed to be honest. I wish it would‚Äôve come in a box similar to the box which iPhones originally come in, being more similar to a case than a cheap paper box.

42606,B0775H5HJW,Kelly,4,"November 21, 2019",True,iPhone X 256gb (Silver),"I was very nervous about buying a refurbished phone, but everyone in my 5 person family all needed a new phone at the same time. I knew that would be costly since we use Straight Talk and would have to buy unlocked phones at full cost up front. I am writing this review for all three phones I purchased from this seller, but I will only attach photos of the specific phone the review is attached to. 2 - iPhone X 1 - iPhone Xs Max All refurbished. The phones came well packaged in ""Certified Refurbished"" boxes. All phones are GSM or Fully Unlocked and all work with Straight Talk service. I was able to just transfer the SIM card they were already using to the new phones without service interruption. ***iPhone X 256gb (Silver): The back is flawless. The screen has VERY minor blemishes that appear to have been caused by over buffing/polishing the glass. Nowhere near bad enough to send the phone back. I mean... I got an iPhone X 256gb for $500. I seriously can't complain about that. We decided to go on and give the kids their phones (Christmas gifts) early just to make sure they were fully functional. This phone works like new and is a HUGE upgrade from my 12 year olds Samsung Galaxy S4 which was a hand-me-down to make sure she was responsible enough for a phone. To say she is ecstatic is an understatement. This phone gets an A- for the scratches on the screen and the fact that it was missing the sim card key. (Btw, the Silver looks more like white.) iPhone X 256gb (Space Gray): The screen is flawless. The back has extremely minor wear and tear scratches. Nothing a case won't cover up. We decided to go on and give the kids their phones (Christmas gifts) early just to make sure they were fully functional. This phone works like new and is an upgrade from my 16 year olds Samsung Galaxy S7 which was a hand-me-down because he broke his old iPhone 5 (Don't let your kid put their phone in their backpack with heavy textbooks!). He is so happy to have a ""new to you"" iPhone. This phone gets an A++ for having all promised parts and better than expected condition. You can't beat a price of $520 for this condition either! iPhone Xs Max 256gb (Space Gray): This phone had wear and tear scratches all over. Like they never used a case, but never dropped it either. This one was bought for my husband. He chose a refurbished Xs Max over the new 11 Pro Max because as a firefighter, he is extremely rough on his phones. $700 was way better than $1,500. He upgraded from an iPhone 6s. Other than the minor cosmetic issues, this phone has exceeded our expectations. It gets an A simply because of the cosmetics, which wear easily covered with a screen protector and an Otterbox. Over all, I do recommend this seller. And if you want to save some money, or you're buying a phone for your kids who will more than likely break it, don't be afraid to try a refurbished phone.

There is absolutely no way to turn off the sound, even when the phone is muted and the volume is turned all the way down. It happens in every major application that uses the camera. As an art student, I take TONS of pictures, and the camera is the primary reason why I got the iPhone X. I took it to multiple IT stores where they told me to either return the phone or to jailbreak it to rewrite the lines of code that affect the feature (and jailbreaking voids any warranty or service that Apple offers). I'm returning it because it's too big of a hiccup to work around (can't take pictures in a wedding/library/quiet setting at all...!). Ideally, they should make sure that the country of origin is taken into consideration before selling someone a product if it's going to be such a major feature difference.

Also I could totally see that the display was replaced and the sealing glue was oozing out from left upper side of display. Such kind of phone would not stand against water spills.

48514,B07D6TQP6F,Chad Bambrick,1,"September 19, 2019",True,Not as they claim,"This item is claimed to be a ""functioning like new"" device, but this is NOT TRUE AT ALL. Let me walk through this dramatic tragedy in detail. I had been monitoring the package from the moment after purchase, so it wasn't an accident that on that bright, sunny day I was waiting by the mailbox as the delivery truck cruised in. Grabbing my package, I ran inside, ecstatic at the prospect of my newest gadget. Gazing at that chrome-plated beauty, I knew love at first sight was true. As I set up this electronic treasure, I tap into ""settings"" to feast my eyes on the sight you rarely see in an iPhone... the battery at full capacity reader proudly gleaming a 100% like-new condition. But no, what sight met my eyes gave me a horror as you would not believe. Eighty....... Three...... Percent...... Now my mind was racing. I had already vowed til death do us part, but now looking at my bride's screen I realized what I had to do. I needed a second doctors opinion. I scheduled an appointment as soon as we returned from the honeymoon with Apple Memorial Hospital, and settled in to an uneasy vacation with my new love.... it was then that tragedy struck. As I started editing a slow motion video of a man breaking an egg on his forehead, the screen flickered and died. I gently tried to shake her awake, hitting the power and volume button up and down (Mainly down. A volume button being obviously a huge plus on a wife) As I rushed her to the ER at the nearest Apple Memorial Hospital I feared the worst. And the worst is what I got. Her heart, (known as a smart board) had failed. She would never speak to me again. I never saw her eyes open since that day, and I'll never forget the last image I saw of her, as the egg was making it's final impact on that man's head. I don't tell this story for self pity. I realize that this may be emotional for many of you to recall similar moments in your life's past. Perhaps even recent past. I share this only from a place of love and concern for other members of this community in the Amazon, that you don't make the same mistakes as I did. I will add one last word and say I have found support groups especially helpful during this emotional time. Thank you all for your time, and I hope you never buy.. *ahem, marry* a bride from this father-in-law.

I tried to submit a warranty request for their 90 day warranty but they wanted me to return the phone and be without one for more than a week and go through another 10hrs of wiping data and reloading data/signing in and setting up apps. I was also out of the country and couldn‚Äôt do that. Anyway they still get one extra star for providing decent service and having an ok product. After I fix these things though could have just bought a new one. So think about that first. You might get lucky. You might not My initial review (3 stars): Generally this phone is in pretty good shape. Battery life is at 89%, the case is nice, and the photo lens is clear. But there is a noticeable scratch in the display that is visible at greater than 12in distance.

48847,B07D6TQP6F,Alex,2,"August 11, 2018",False,iPhone X After Half A Years Use,"I would first like to say that I have supported apple for a long time but this phone is unreliable and not worth the money. I have held off on writing a review in hopes that this phone would improve but it continues to be crap. My first issue with this phone is it's lack of a headphone jack. Now when I purchased this phone I knew I would have to carry around an adapter and I was willing to accept that; however, I was not prepared for my phone to not play music or connect even when I had said adapter. Furthermore, it used to not continuously charge meaning I would constantly have to re-plug it in and now it refuses to charge all together. Also, it will stop playing songs or Siri will turn on (even after I disabled her) for no reason. In addition, the camera will constantly freeze when I try to zoom in which has often stopped me from taking amazing photos. All in all this phone is glitchy, not worth the money, ugly (I mean did they really think making the top dip down was a good idea?), and will ultimately annoy you to the point where you have to write a rant online and not even on the official website because apple doesn't want to hear people's opinions.",28.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone X, 256GB, Silver - For AT&T (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-AT-256GB-Refurbished/dp/B07D6TQP6F,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81yZOQEC+NL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,3.9,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07D6TQP6F,436,476.0,0.0
48848,B07D6TQP6F,Christopher Galgon,4,"September 1, 2018",False,"The Cell Phone Equivalent of a Concept Car, for Better and Worse.","The iPhone X is the most exciting phone I've owned since the iPhone 3GS so many years ago. I only recently had an opportunity to get one and it looks amazing, its cameras are spectacular and its quickness can be felt everywhere. Apple knew their design would be exciting, so they skipped over number 9 and made it the ""10,"" as if to say they're showing you a window to the future, just like a concept car. But as we all know, concept cars rarely end up on the assembly line without a few changes, and with good reason. Here's why the iPhone X, for all its power and beauty, really just deserves a ""B"" for its design: 1) The phone's signature looks turn anonymous inside a case. 2) The phone's surfaces all scratch easily. 3) It is the most slippery phone I've ever encountered. Add these things together, and you have a beautiful phone that MUST be put in an obscuring case, which makes its beauty kind of pointless. Inside a case and switched off, it doesn't even have Apple's signature circular button to identify itself. As of right now, I only have glass protectors on the front and back, but I know what will happen if I keep it like this long-term. The other new feature on the iPhone X is Face ID, or ""expensive way to avoid having a button on the front of the phone."" It works fine, but requires mild adjustments in how you use your phone and is definitely no better than Touch ID. I turned off the ""attention detection,"" meaning I don't have to be looking directly at the phone to unlock it, and now it is quick and unobtrusive. Finally, there's the ""notch."" This is a non-issue. I don't know what the fuss is about unless you're a software designer. Moving on. All in all, I've had my iPhone X for a couple months and couldn't be happier. It is not perfect, and I'll bet it'll be completely replaced by Fall 2019 (now that designer Jonny Ive is back in charge), but I'm loving everything about it.

55391,B07KFNRQ5S,AARAWN,5,"December 9, 2018",False,Best smartphone made (not kidding),"I‚Äôve owned my iPhone XS Max for a little over a month now. Let me say this, I started with the original iPhone and kept them through the 4S. I made the switch to Galaxy, and had those through the S6 Edge. Made the switch back and I can tell you my user experience is better than any phone ever. I was definitely the one that argued Galaxy are superior. For many reasons they are. I‚Äôve played with the X, and was disappointed. Pros: Battery life is superior to anything I‚Äôve owned Reception hands down is the BEST. I can use it without issue in the big department stores that plague everyone. The feel of this phone is luxury at minimum. It‚Äôs flawless in your hands. It‚Äôs faster than any galaxy or iPhone I‚Äôve ever used and tried (Note 8 and S9) The apps are just designed better. I am a very heavy user and stream EVERYTHING. I have never had an issue with reception, speed or lagging, ever. 3D Touch and face recognition are super fast and user friendly. I‚Äôve noticed face recognition gets better with use. It‚Äôs constantly calibrating, which means as you change, so it does. The camera, hands down is such an incredible quality. Both features and image quality. You know this about iPhone, and ignore marketing of other companies, it‚Äôs BS. Wireless charging is lightning fast Seamlessly connects with iPad and they automatically update each other with apps etc. THIS is super cool!!! The speakers are incredible! I actually have to turn it down a couple notches as it‚Äôs very loud The new Gold is just absolutely stunning. The backing is a pearlized gold and the trim around it is a classy and metal gold. Stunning Cons: Pricey No headphone jack All glass (doesn‚Äôt bother me as I am extremely careful with my phones) but the average person that drops, you need to put a case on. No headphones included No cable included (I bought a 5 pack from Amazon anyway beforehand, so it‚Äôs a non issue) The notch. Bit of an odd eyesore but in turn I get HD quality calls and reverse camera functionality) Overall this truly is an incredible device.",146.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone Xs Max, 256GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Max-Fully-Unlocked/dp/B07KFNRQ5S,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XeQzRDyML._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07KFNRQ5S,230,664.99,0.0
55392,B07KFNRQ5S,Alexis Argueta,4,"February 15, 2019",False,Review,"INTRO I bought the iPhone XS Max on the first day it came out on September 12, 2018. I purchased the 64gb gold model. I have owned other iPhones in the past such as the 6 and 8 plus and many other Apple products. I‚Äôve also had Androids and many different types of PC‚Äôs. In this review I will focus on mainly the camera and battery. IDEAL USER The ideal user for the iPhone XS Max would be someone who has owned an iPhone before. The reason I say this is because it has so many similarities to its previous models such as the format of the apps. Also, the shortcuts on this new iPhone are extremely similar to the old generations. CAMERA In my opinion, the iPhone XS Max camera is one of the best and offers amazing advantages. There is this new feature where you can now change the depth of field of a picture that has already been taken. Another plus is that you can do this to photos that have taken by both the front and back camera unlike androids. Some androids can also adjust the depth of field but only before the picture is taken and not after. I use this feature all the time and improves the picture dramatically, making them look professionally taken. BATTERY LIFE The battery life for the iPhone XS Max is the biggest battery that has ever been on a iPhone. It can even last an hour a half longer than its previous model the X. I start off my day with a fully charged phone every day and stream music, watch videos, roam social media for hours and it does not die. It is at a low percentage, but it still has battery. So basically, one full charge can last you the whole day maybe even two. OVERALL Overall, this phone is good phone for anyone who wants to upgrade from their older generation model. The camera will never fail you, it‚Äôs the best on the market and offers many editing abilities with the camera. The battery is so big on the XS Max that you won‚Äôt always need to carry your charger with you. These are the only things I could talk about in a short review because this phone has so many advantages.",88.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone Xs Max, 256GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Max-Fully-Unlocked/dp/B07KFNRQ5S,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XeQzRDyML._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07KFNRQ5S,230,664.99,0.0

55397,B07KFNRQ5S,Daniel T.,3,"July 25, 2019",True,So far so great!,"I was initially skeptical about buying a used phone, but the experience so far has been great. I've been playing with the phone for the past few days and held off before writing a review to test things out. There weren't any major scratches/dents on the device, with an exception to some small scratches on the stainless steel bezel. Those were probably inevitable anyways, and can easily be polished out with a Cape Cod cloth. The screen didn't have any scratches visible to the naked eye, and was in very good condition. One thing I have noticed is that when turned off the device takes sometimes up to 20 seconds or more before powering on, which I don't know if is common for iPhones as this is my first one. Another thing I thought I would be worried about is the battery health, which hasn't been a problem. In fact, the model I got was at 100%! This makes me believe it was either recently changed or Apple has some serious durability on their battery, as I've gone over a whole day without charging when starting at 100%. Everything feels fast, and works as it should. I also had some time left the original apple 1 year warranty, so should be covered for the next few months. Overall, I can't speak for other sellers, but SikkSound gave me a very good phone! However, I would recommend buying from a reputable seller on Amazon if you're going the used route, and to be able to make sure you can return if there are any problems, since it can honestly be a crapshoot from what I've read in other reviews. I will update my rating if anything changes or goes wrong with the phone. EDIT: After using the phone for just a few months, there is now a speaker problem with the speaker. It has a very noticeable distortion when playing audio. I haven't exposed it to water or dropped it at all.

55409,B07KFNRQ5S,JS1124,5,"December 19, 2019",True,Beautiful phone with amazing performance.,"First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it. The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place! Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS. I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before. Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the extremely ugly new camera on it. Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you. Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive. So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.",1.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone Xs Max, 256GB, Space Gray - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Max-Fully-Unlocked/dp/B07KFNRQ5S,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XeQzRDyML._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07KFNRQ5S,230,664.99,0.0

55551,B07KFNRQ5S,Jeff S,5,"December 4, 2018",False,Better than Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge,"Ok here is my review of my new iPhone XS Max. It replaces a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Battery: The battery is excellent and here‚Äôs why. Obviously the antenna in the Samsung was awful because I would use 30% of the battery traveling from Central Massachusetts to western Mass, a 50 mile trip but there would be spots where it couldn‚Äôt find a tower and the battery usage skyrocketed when that happened. This is not a problem with the iPhone, so the antenna must be way better, or whatever technology it is that‚Äôs different from Samsung, it‚Äôs better. I could never get through a day without needing to recharge the Galaxy. I use the phone a lot for listening to music (battery drain), Google searches, Instagram and Twitter. With the iPhone my usage has not changed if anything has increased due to the novelty of the new phone yet I have been able to get through every day (except the day of purchase when it was not fully charged out of the box) without charging the battery during the day. The iPhone, also doesn‚Äôt burn a hole in my pants pocket or heat other objects when it‚Äôs battery consumption is high. Antenna: Continuing on the antenna subject, I work in a Home Depot and the Samsung had issues getting reception and wifi in the store. No such issue with the XS Max. I also don‚Äôt lose reception where I did traveling on the road to western Mass. Music and speakers: The speakers in the iPhone are head and shoulders above the Galaxy and sound much more professional or like they are bigger. The sound is rich and full bodied and I don‚Äôt mind listening to music on the phone. Copying music to the phone took (6) minutes as opposed to an hour compared to the Galaxy when I had to do that when the Galaxy was new. That‚Äôs over 3000 songs if anyone is counting. The music interface is iTunes which was a learning curve but a quick one. I liked the music player I had in the Galaxy better but I‚Äôm still learning iTunes. Music also sounds better on my car stereo coming out of the iPhone than it did from the Galaxy. I had noticed this when my son would play a song I had on my phone using his iPhone in my car, the quality was significantly better coming from his phone which I thought was strange, but the same phenomenon exists with my new iPhone and my car. Siri: Where have you been all my life? Siri's functionality is far superior to the Galaxy‚Äôs S Voice. I don‚Äôt have to touch my iPhone to send texts, play music etc. I just have to tell Siri to do it, even if the phone is locked. This is a huge advantage over the Galaxy S Voice which is supposed to do the same thing but I could never get it to work consistently or even at all. Facial Recognition versus Finger Print Scanner: The iPhone facial recognition wins again. The only app I have needing finger print recognition is my bank app, but I am still able to use it by typing the password in. All other apps I have use facial recognition, Amazon, Starbucks, and other apps needing credit card authorization. There are more facial recognition apps than finger print scanner ones. Facial Recognition works even in really low light like darkness. Speed. The iPhone is Faster period. My Starbucks app took 30 seconds to load on my Galaxy, on the iPhone it takes 5 seconds; that‚Äôs significantly faster especially when you‚Äôre in line at the drive thru!!! Maybe that‚Äôs not a fair comparison but it‚Äôs reality. Screen Resolution: Here the Galaxy has the win, hands down. The iPhone is close but it just can‚Äôt compete with the Galaxy screen colors and resolution. It‚Äôs not a big enough of a difference maker considering all of the iPhone wins so far. That and the iPhone XS Max screen is actually larger edge to edge than the Galaxy. Camera: I don‚Äôt take many photos with the phone but what I have taken I do notice the Galaxy was better in the photo quality area. Jury still out on this one. Keyboard or keyboard apps: Galaxy wins here. At least until I find a swipe able keyboard I like as much as the one I had on the Galaxy. Look and Feel: iPhone wins over Galaxy S7 Edge because I grew tired of the edge screen causing issues. Such as touching the edge just a little, and it was hard to know you were touching it, would make the screen appear unresponsive. Even though the iPhone has an edge to edge screen it does not suffer from this behavior probably due to the way it fits in my hand. I am just glad I don‚Äôt have to hit the screen 7 times before I get a response. Size and weight: the XS Max is the same size as the Galaxy S7 Edge and weighs about the same, I know not scientific but their weight is similar. Tie Headphone jack: None on iPhone and who cares really? What you don‚Äôt own a pair of Bluetooth headphones already? But you‚Äôre spending how much on this phone??? Right, if you think the Headphone jack is a selling point you‚Äôre in the dark ages. As you can tell I like the iPhone a lot. Can‚Äôt believe I waited this long to switch.

The cameras are what you can expect from an iPhone (awesome). It's just hard to explain to him why it doesn't have a headphone jack and what happened to the fingerprint scanner. If it had those two it'd be a great phone, but it'll have to settle for being just a great iPhone. Also, the price stung a lot. He says sometimes regrets not getting a Samsung S10 because that did have all the features he wanted for less price and arguably similar quality. Yet, he really likes iOS, and that transition would be a little difficult for him. So to wrap it up, if you're tied into the iOS ecosystem, this is a great phone.

I have never had an issue with reception, speed or lagging, ever. 3D Touch and face recognition are super fast and user friendly. I‚Äôve noticed face recognition gets better with use. It‚Äôs constantly calibrating, which means as you change, so it does. The camera, hands down is such an incredible quality. Both features and image quality. You know this about iPhone, and ignore marketing of other companies, it‚Äôs BS. Wireless charging is lightning fast Seamlessly connects with iPad and they automatically update each other with apps etc. THIS is super cool!!! The speakers are incredible! I actually have to turn it down a couple notches as it‚Äôs very loud The new Gold is just absolutely stunning. The backing is a pearlized gold and the trim around it is a classy and metal gold. Stunning Cons: Pricey No headphone jack All glass (doesn‚Äôt bother me as I am extremely careful with my phones) but the average person that drops, you need to put a case on. No headphones included No cable included (I bought a 5 pack from Amazon anyway beforehand, so it‚Äôs a non issue) The notch. Bit of an odd eyesore but in turn I get HD quality calls and reverse camera functionality) Overall this truly is an incredible device.",146.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone XS Max, 256GB, Gray - For AT&T (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Max-256GB-Gray/dp/B07RDMLR4V,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nSsCFeiTL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07RDMLR4V,230,651.58,0.0
62997,B07RDMLR4V,Alexis Argueta,4,"February 15, 2019",False,Review,"INTRO I bought the iPhone XS Max on the first day it came out on September 12, 2018. I purchased the 64gb gold model. I have owned other iPhones in the past such as the 6 and 8 plus and many other Apple products. I‚Äôve also had Androids and many different types of PC‚Äôs. In this review I will focus on mainly the camera and battery. IDEAL USER The ideal user for the iPhone XS Max would be someone who has owned an iPhone before. The reason I say this is because it has so many similarities to its previous models such as the format of the apps. Also, the shortcuts on this new iPhone are extremely similar to the old generations. CAMERA In my opinion, the iPhone XS Max camera is one of the best and offers amazing advantages. There is this new feature where you can now change the depth of field of a picture that has already been taken. Another plus is that you can do this to photos that have taken by both the front and back camera unlike androids. Some androids can also adjust the depth of field but only before the picture is taken and not after. I use this feature all the time and improves the picture dramatically, making them look professionally taken. BATTERY LIFE The battery life for the iPhone XS Max is the biggest battery that has ever been on a iPhone. It can even last an hour a half longer than its previous model the X. I start off my day with a fully charged phone every day and stream music, watch videos, roam social media for hours and it does not die. It is at a low percentage, but it still has battery. So basically, one full charge can last you the whole day maybe even two. OVERALL Overall, this phone is good phone for anyone who wants to upgrade from their older generation model. The camera will never fail you, it‚Äôs the best on the market and offers many editing abilities with the camera. The battery is so big on the XS Max that you won‚Äôt always need to carry your charger with you. These are the only things I could talk about in a short review because this phone has so many advantages.",88.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone XS Max, 256GB, Gray - For AT&T (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Max-256GB-Gray/dp/B07RDMLR4V,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nSsCFeiTL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07RDMLR4V,230,651.58,0.0

63002,B07RDMLR4V,Daniel T.,3,"July 25, 2019",True,So far so great!,"I was initially skeptical about buying a used phone, but the experience so far has been great. I've been playing with the phone for the past few days and held off before writing a review to test things out. There weren't any major scratches/dents on the device, with an exception to some small scratches on the stainless steel bezel. Those were probably inevitable anyways, and can easily be polished out with a Cape Cod cloth. The screen didn't have any scratches visible to the naked eye, and was in very good condition. One thing I have noticed is that when turned off the device takes sometimes up to 20 seconds or more before powering on, which I don't know if is common for iPhones as this is my first one. Another thing I thought I would be worried about is the battery health, which hasn't been a problem. In fact, the model I got was at 100%! This makes me believe it was either recently changed or Apple has some serious durability on their battery, as I've gone over a whole day without charging when starting at 100%. Everything feels fast, and works as it should. I also had some time left the original apple 1 year warranty, so should be covered for the next few months. Overall, I can't speak for other sellers, but SikkSound gave me a very good phone! However, I would recommend buying from a reputable seller on Amazon if you're going the used route, and to be able to make sure you can return if there are any problems, since it can honestly be a crapshoot from what I've read in other reviews. I will update my rating if anything changes or goes wrong with the phone. EDIT: After using the phone for just a few months, there is now a speaker problem with the speaker. It has a very noticeable distortion when playing audio. I haven't exposed it to water or dropped it at all.

63014,B07RDMLR4V,JS1124,5,"December 19, 2019",True,Beautiful phone with amazing performance.,"First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it. The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place! Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS. I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before. Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the extremely ugly new camera on it. Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you. Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive. So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.",1.0,Apple,"Apple iPhone XS Max, 256GB, Gray - For AT&T (Renewed)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Max-256GB-Gray/dp/B07RDMLR4V,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nSsCFeiTL._AC_UY218_ML3_.jpg,4.1,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07RDMLR4V,230,651.58,0.0

I should be an expert on touching icons by now; yet still it happens. The apps this phone can use are really great and fun; but they need to seriously work on a hands free device and triple their man hours on the glitches and errors. Let the Chinese use the newest IOS for a year before releasing to the rest of the world; so they can deal with all the problems. One more thing; stop making the outside of the phone so slick; The slightest degree this phone is from horizontal, and there it falls off.

63156,B07RDMLR4V,Jeff S,5,"December 4, 2018",False,Better than Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge,"Ok here is my review of my new iPhone XS Max. It replaces a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Battery: The battery is excellent and here‚Äôs why. Obviously the antenna in the Samsung was awful because I would use 30% of the battery traveling from Central Massachusetts to western Mass, a 50 mile trip but there would be spots where it couldn‚Äôt find a tower and the battery usage skyrocketed when that happened. This is not a problem with the iPhone, so the antenna must be way better, or whatever technology it is that‚Äôs different from Samsung, it‚Äôs better. I could never get through a day without needing to recharge the Galaxy. I use the phone a lot for listening to music (battery drain), Google searches, Instagram and Twitter. With the iPhone my usage has not changed if anything has increased due to the novelty of the new phone yet I have been able to get through every day (except the day of purchase when it was not fully charged out of the box) without charging the battery during the day. The iPhone, also doesn‚Äôt burn a hole in my pants pocket or heat other objects when it‚Äôs battery consumption is high. Antenna: Continuing on the antenna subject, I work in a Home Depot and the Samsung had issues getting reception and wifi in the store. No such issue with the XS Max. I also don‚Äôt lose reception where I did traveling on the road to western Mass. Music and speakers: The speakers in the iPhone are head and shoulders above the Galaxy and sound much more professional or like they are bigger. The sound is rich and full bodied and I don‚Äôt mind listening to music on the phone. Copying music to the phone took (6) minutes as opposed to an hour compared to the Galaxy when I had to do that when the Galaxy was new. That‚Äôs over 3000 songs if anyone is counting. The music interface is iTunes which was a learning curve but a quick one. I liked the music player I had in the Galaxy better but I‚Äôm still learning iTunes. Music also sounds better on my car stereo coming out of the iPhone than it did from the Galaxy. I had noticed this when my son would play a song I had on my phone using his iPhone in my car, the quality was significantly better coming from his phone which I thought was strange, but the same phenomenon exists with my new iPhone and my car. Siri: Where have you been all my life? Siri's functionality is far superior to the Galaxy‚Äôs S Voice. I don‚Äôt have to touch my iPhone to send texts, play music etc. I just have to tell Siri to do it, even if the phone is locked. This is a huge advantage over the Galaxy S Voice which is supposed to do the same thing but I could never get it to work consistently or even at all. Facial Recognition versus Finger Print Scanner: The iPhone facial recognition wins again. The only app I have needing finger print recognition is my bank app, but I am still able to use it by typing the password in. All other apps I have use facial recognition, Amazon, Starbucks, and other apps needing credit card authorization. There are more facial recognition apps than finger print scanner ones. Facial Recognition works even in really low light like darkness. Speed. The iPhone is Faster period. My Starbucks app took 30 seconds to load on my Galaxy, on the iPhone it takes 5 seconds; that‚Äôs significantly faster especially when you‚Äôre in line at the drive thru!!! Maybe that‚Äôs not a fair comparison but it‚Äôs reality. Screen Resolution: Here the Galaxy has the win, hands down. The iPhone is close but it just can‚Äôt compete with the Galaxy screen colors and resolution. It‚Äôs not a big enough of a difference maker considering all of the iPhone wins so far. That and the iPhone XS Max screen is actually larger edge to edge than the Galaxy. Camera: I don‚Äôt take many photos with the phone but what I have taken I do notice the Galaxy was better in the photo quality area. Jury still out on this one. Keyboard or keyboard apps: Galaxy wins here. At least until I find a swipe able keyboard I like as much as the one I had on the Galaxy. Look and Feel: iPhone wins over Galaxy S7 Edge because I grew tired of the edge screen causing issues. Such as touching the edge just a little, and it was hard to know you were touching it, would make the screen appear unresponsive. Even though the iPhone has an edge to edge screen it does not suffer from this behavior probably due to the way it fits in my hand. I am just glad I don‚Äôt have to hit the screen 7 times before I get a response. Size and weight: the XS Max is the same size as the Galaxy S7 Edge and weighs about the same, I know not scientific but their weight is similar. Tie Headphone jack: None on iPhone and who cares really? What you don‚Äôt own a pair of Bluetooth headphones already? But you‚Äôre spending how much on this phone??? Right, if you think the Headphone jack is a selling point you‚Äôre in the dark ages. As you can tell I like the iPhone a lot. Can‚Äôt believe I waited this long to switch.

The cameras are what you can expect from an iPhone (awesome). It's just hard to explain to him why it doesn't have a headphone jack and what happened to the fingerprint scanner. If it had those two it'd be a great phone, but it'll have to settle for being just a great iPhone. Also, the price stung a lot. He says sometimes regrets not getting a Samsung S10 because that did have all the features he wanted for less price and arguably similar quality. Yet, he really likes iOS, and that transition would be a little difficult for him. So to wrap it up, if you're tied into the iOS ecosystem, this is a great phone.

Occasionally the data/ wifi connection gets iffy. I still have the same plan as i did w my 6 and still the same circumstances (same home wifi, same job/ school ect) calls/ facetime will occasionally freeze/ sound fuzzy if i am not connected to wifi. That was never a problem with my 6 (my 6 was a GSM unlocked, idk if that has anything to do with it) I wear glass, and sometimes the face ID does not recognize me if i do not have them on. Battery life is great! And i like being able to access low power mode easier than having to go through settings all the time! All in all, good phone. I can tell you one thing, it is not worth $600+.
